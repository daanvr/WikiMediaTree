# Features Specification

## Overview
This document details all features and functionality of WikiMediaTree, a hierarchical visualization tool for exploring relationships between Wikimedia Commons categories and Wikidata items.

## Core Features

### Feature 1: Interactive Canvas
**Description:** A pannable, zoomable canvas that serves as the primary interface for visualizing hierarchical relationships in all directions.

**User Story:** As a Wikimedian, I want to freely navigate across large hierarchical structures so that I can explore complex category and item relationships without being constrained by traditional page-based navigation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Canvas supports smooth panning in all directions (up, down, left, right, diagonal)
- [ ] Users can zoom in and out to view different levels of detail
- [ ] Canvas performance remains smooth with large numbers of blocks
- [ ] Viewport shows current position indicator
- [ ] Canvas boundaries adapt dynamically to content

**Technical Notes:** Implement using Canvas API with coordinate transformation system and viewport management. Include requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations.

### Feature 2: Block-Based Visualization
**Description:** Visual representation of Commons categories and Wikidata items as interactive blocks that form the building blocks of hierarchical trees.

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to see clear visual distinctions between Commons categories, Wikidata items, and hybrid entities so that I can understand the structure and identify missing connections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Blocks visually distinguish between Commons-only, Wikidata-only, and hybrid entities
- [ ] Each block displays connection status indicators
- [ ] File count and subcategory count are prominently displayed
- [ ] Parent relationship type is visually indicated
- [ ] Blocks show hover states with additional information
- [ ] Direct links to Commons and Wikidata pages are accessible

**Technical Notes:** Use different CSS classes/styles for block types. Implement tooltip system for hover information. Include click handlers for external links.

### Feature 3: Hierarchical Tree Navigation
**Description:** Family tree-like visualization showing parent-child relationships with the ability to expand and collapse branches dynamically.

**User Story:** As a Wikimedia developer, I want to explore hierarchical structures as expandable trees so that I can understand complex relationships and identify areas needing organization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Trees display in family tree format with clear parent-child connections
- [ ] Users can expand branches by clicking on expandable arrows
- [ ] Users can collapse branches to reduce visual complexity
- [ ] Trees can grow in any direction based on user exploration
- [ ] Visual indicators show unexplored branches
- [ ] Root blocks are clearly identified

**Technical Notes:** Implement tree data structure with lazy loading. Use SVG lines or Canvas drawing for connections. Include expand/collapse animations.

---

### Feature 4: Hierarchy View Switching
**Description:** Ability to switch between Commons category hierarchy and Wikidata item hierarchy when both exist for the same conceptual entity.

**User Story:** As a Wikidata editor, I want to compare Commons category hierarchies with Wikidata item hierarchies so that I can identify inconsistencies and improve structured data organization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can switch between Commons and Wikidata hierarchy views
- [ ] Switching preserves current focus and position context
- [ ] Visual indicators show which hierarchy view is currently active
- [ ] Mismatches between hierarchies are highlighted
- [ ] Smooth transitions between hierarchy views

**Technical Notes:** Implement view state management with transition animations. Store both hierarchy structures in memory for quick switching.

---

### Feature 5: Advanced Block Interactions
**Description:** Expandable block details, drag-and-drop functionality, and context-sensitive actions for organizing and editing hierarchical structures.

**User Story:** As a Commons contributor, I want to organize photos and categories by dragging and dropping them in the hierarchy so that I can efficiently restructure content organization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Blocks can be expanded to show detailed information
- [ ] Drag and drop functionality for moving items in hierarchy
- [ ] Context menus provide relevant actions for each block type
- [ ] Bulk selection and operations for multiple blocks
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality for hierarchy changes
- [ ] Visual feedback during drag operations

**Technical Notes:** Implement HTML5 drag and drop API with visual feedback. Include command pattern for undo/redo functionality.

---

### Feature 6: Wikidata Information Panel
**Description:** Expandable side panel displaying comprehensive Wikidata item information including properties, images, and related data.

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to see detailed Wikidata information for items so that I can understand entity properties and relationships without leaving the visualization interface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Side panel expands to show Wikidata item details
- [ ] Display label, description, and instance of properties
- [ ] Show associated images and media
- [ ] Include relevant Wikidata properties and values
- [ ] Links to full Wikidata item page
- [ ] Panel can be resized and repositioned

**Technical Notes:** Create responsive panel component with SPARQL query integration for fetching detailed Wikidata information.

---

### Feature 7: Visual Hierarchy Indicators
**Description:** Visual cues showing additional parent categories, relationship types, and navigation hints to help users understand complex hierarchical structures.

**User Story:** As a general Wikimedian, I want to see visual indicators of hidden hierarchy branches so that I can understand the full scope of relationships and navigate efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Lines extending upward indicate additional parent categories
- [ ] Hover tooltips show names of hidden parent categories
- [ ] Click actions navigate to hidden parent hierarchies
- [ ] Visual distinction between Commons and Wikidata relationship lines
- [ ] Breadcrumb-style navigation indicators
- [ ] Visual indication of relationship strength/type

**Technical Notes:** Use CSS animations and SVG graphics for visual indicators. Implement hover detection and tooltip positioning system.

---

### Feature 8: Tree Manipulation Tools
**Description:** Tools for removing/quitting parts of trees, adding new branches, and cleaning up hierarchical structures.

**User Story:** As a content organizer, I want to remove irrelevant branches from my view and add new connections so that I can focus on specific areas and improve organizational structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can remove/hide specific branches from current view
- [ ] Ability to add new blocks and connections
- [ ] Undo functionality for tree modifications
- [ ] Save and load custom tree configurations
- [ ] Export tree structures for documentation
- [ ] Validation to prevent invalid hierarchical relationships

**Technical Notes:** Implement tree manipulation commands with validation logic. Include local storage for saving configurations.

---

### Feature 9: Mismatch Detection and Highlighting
**Description:** Automatic detection and visual highlighting of inconsistencies between Commons category hierarchies and Wikidata item hierarchies.

**User Story:** As a structured data advocate, I want to identify where Commons categories and Wikidata items don't align so that I can improve consistency across Wikimedia projects.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Automatic detection of hierarchy mismatches
- [ ] Visual highlighting of inconsistent relationships
- [ ] Suggestions for creating missing categories or items
- [ ] Tools for reporting and tracking mismatches
- [ ] Integration with creation workflows for missing entities
- [ ] Statistics on hierarchy alignment quality

**Technical Notes:** Implement comparison algorithms between hierarchy structures. Use visual styling to highlight mismatches.

- [ ] Quick navigation shortcuts and keyboard controls

**Technical Notes:** Integrate with Commons and Wikidata search APIs. Implement client-side search index for visited items.
